# PREDICTION-ANALYSIS
his project aims to predict the intensity of daily rainfall using machine learning algorithms such as Multivariate Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron Regressor, KNeighbors Regressor, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regression. It focuses on identifying relevant atmospheric features that cause rainfall.
